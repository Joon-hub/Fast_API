### Git Branch Management and File Operations Summary

#### Checking the Current Branch

To check which branch you are currently working on, use the following command:
```bash
git branch
```
The current branch will be marked with an asterisk (*).

#### Creating a New Branch from the Main Branch

1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main  # or git switch main
   ```

2. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name  # or git switch -c new-branch-name
   ```

#### Pushing Changes from One Branch to Another (Without Affecting Main)

1. Ensure you have the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch
   ```

2. Switch to `branch 1` and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout 1_Introduction  # or git switch 1_Introduction
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin 1_Introduction
   ```

3. Switch to `branch 2`:
   ```bash
   git checkout 2_path_parmeters  # or git switch 2_path_parmeters
   ```

4. Merge changes from `branch 1` to `branch 2`:
   ```bash
   git merge 1_Introduction
   ```

5. Push the changes to `branch 2`:
   ```bash
   git push origin 2_path_parmeters
   ```

#### Deleting a File from the Main Branch

1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main  # or git switch main
   ```

2. Delete the file:
   ```bash
   rm path/to/main.py
   ```

3. Stage the deletion:
   ```bash
   git add -u
   ```

4. Commit the deletion:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Delete main.py from main branch"
   ```

5. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Moving a Folder out of `__pycache__`

1. Ensure you are on the correct branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch-name  # or git switch your-branch-name
   ```

2. Move the folder:
   ```bash
   mv __pycache__/notes .
   ```

3. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Move notes folder out of __pycache__"
   ```

5. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Notes

- **Origin**: The default name for the remote repository from which you cloned your project.
- **Fetching Changes**: `git fetch origin` retrieves updates from the remote repository without merging them.
- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names for branches to indicate their purpose.
- **Staging Changes**: `git add .` stages all changes, while `git add -u` stages modifications and deletions of tracked files.
- **Committing Changes**: Use meaningful commit messages to describe the changes made.
- **Switching Branches**: Use `git checkout branch_name` or `git switch branch_name` to switch between branches.

By following these summarized steps and notes, you can efficiently manage branches and file operations in your Git repository.
